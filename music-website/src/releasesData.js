            <p>My first EP is finally out now! This first EP project is a dream..It was no small feat as an indie artist, an amateur at most things and a really sappy human being lol. These songs not only reveal
                my share of heartaches but they also are reflective of some of my deepest longings.I hope these songs allow you to feel deeply, however your heart takes each of them, and inspire you in some way. Thank you for listening and sharing. Thank you for giving my songs
                (and my heart really) a chance to be seen and heard. More to come!
                Special thanks to the wonderful @haydenarpmusic for engineering and singing on the title track.'</p>,
